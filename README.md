## About Me

UP Cebu Computer Science grad (Cum Laude) who builds production-ready systems. Did my internship at ChatGenie (Techstars '23) where I learned that shipping fast matters, but shipping secure matters more.

Recently built a production-grade RAG knowledge base with advanced retrieval techniques (HyDE, Multi-Query, Hybrid Search) achieving 85%+ accuracy. Specialized in AI/RAG architecture, blockchain development, and cybersecurity - from vector databases and LLM integration to NFT marketplaces and blockchain explorers. Led a 5-person team building an AI study assistant and presented research at Kyoto University in Japan. Google Cybersecurity certified.

Currently working on MAGSEL (AI metaverse learning) and maintaining AutoFlow Pro (browser automation in production). Building AI automation portfolio with emphasis on RAG systems, multi-agent orchestration, and production optimization.

## Featured Projects

### Enterprise RAG Knowledge Base (Dec 2025)
**Tech**: FastAPI, LangChain, Chroma, Groq, Ollama, Next.js, Redis, Sentence Transformers, Docker
[Live Demo](https://enterprise-rag-knowledge-base.vercel.app) | [Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/enterprise-rag-knowledge-base)

Production-ready RAG system with 5 advanced retrieval strategies: Hybrid Search (vector + BM25), HyDE, Multi-Query, Cross-Encoder Reranking, achieving 67.7% tested accuracy (85%+ with advanced techniques). Full-stack deployment (FastAPI + Next.js) with Redis caching (100x speedup), 2-tier LLM fallback (Ollama → Groq), and 100% reliability across 19 test queries.

Optimized for 512MB RAM using cloud APIs (HuggingFace Inference, Groq) while maintaining local development. BM25 index caching (9.2x speedup), batch processing (11x faster), connection pooling. Demonstrates production-grade RAG architecture beyond basic API wrappers.

### AutoFlow Pro (Nov 2025)
**Tech**: Next.js, Fastify, Playwright, BullMQ, Redis, Supabase, Docker
[Live Demo](https://autoflow-pro.vercel.app/) | [Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/autoflow-pro)

Production-ready browser automation platform with visual workflow builder. Features 23 automation step types (navigation, interaction, data extraction, JavaScript execution) and distributed job processing with BullMQ achieving sub-100ms WebSocket monitoring.

Deployed on free-tier infrastructure (Vercel, Render, Supabase, Upstash Redis, Cloudflare R2) while maintaining <3s page load times and <500ms API response times. Includes enterprise security (RLS, rate limiting, input sanitization) and comprehensive testing (30+ test files).

### NFT Trading Platform (Oct 2025)
**Tech**: Solidity, Hardhat, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, IPFS, Docker
[Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/NFT-Trading)

Full-stack NFT marketplace with ERC-721 smart contracts, batch minting (up to 20 NFTs), and royalty management. Real-time trading feed with WebSocket, analytics dashboard with Recharts, and IPFS metadata storage via Pinata.

52 smart contract tests and 50+ integration tests covering the complete lifecycle. Built to understand Web3 properly - not just another tutorial project.

### Blockchain Explorer (Oct 2025)
**Tech**: Solidity, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, WebSocket, Docker
[Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/Blockchain-Explorer)

Real-time blockchain event indexing with interactive analytics. In-memory LRU cache delivers 8-10x performance improvement with 80-90% hit rate, handling 200-500 req/s with sub-200ms P95 response times.

Batch processing handles 50 events at once with WebSocket throttling for live updates. Features player leaderboards, event distribution charts, and timeline visualization.

### MiniWorld (Oct 2025)
**Tech**: Solidity, React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, Docker
[Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/Miniworld)

Web3 gaming platform with on-chain mechanics. 10x10 grid where players claim tiles and place items, achieving sub-100ms real-time state synchronization. Built a complete TypeScript SDK abstracting Web3 complexity with bundled contract ABI distribution.

Dual frontends (Canvas game client and creator dashboard with analytics) both consuming the centralized SDK. One-command Docker deployment.

### RataTutor (May 2025)
**Tech**: Django, React, Docker, OpenRouter API
[Live Demo](https://ratatutor.onrender.com/) | [Code](https://github.com/Exalt24/RataTutor)

Led 5-person team building AI study assistant that transforms notes (PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX) into flashcards and quizzes. 30+ Django REST API endpoints with hybrid context management (rolling summaries + recent messages) to prevent AI overload.

The interesting challenge was maintaining conversation continuity without overwhelming the AI - turns out context limits matter just like they do for humans cramming at 2 AM.
