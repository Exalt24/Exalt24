## ⚠️ Who dares to skim shall face eternal merge conflicts!

Okay, stop with the nerdy stuff for a sec. Here's the deal:

**With great errors come lousy debugging skills... and I'm guilty as charged.** 🐛

Look, I'm just some guy from Cebu who thought "hey, let's make computers do weird stuff" and somehow ended up down every possible tech rabbit hole. Started with basic HTML (we all did), got addicted to the dopamine hit of working code, and now I'm that person who gets genuinely excited about SQL injection vulnerabilities and thinks game loops are poetry.

```python
class Daniel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.location = "Cebu, Philippines 🏝️"
        self.status = "CS Student @ UP Cebu (Cum Laude, thanks very much)"
        self.day_job = "Breaking and fixing things with code"
        self.night_job = "Bug hunting & game dev (mostly breaking things)"
        self.coffee_dependency = "CRITICAL"
        self.debugging_style = "Print statements everywhere, fight me"
        
    def current_obsession(self):
        return [
            "Making AI that doesn't hallucinate your data away",
            "Security tools that devs actually want to use", 
            "Metaverse stuff (yeah, I said it) for education",
            "Game development (because why sleep?)"
        ]
    
    def unpopular_opinions(self):
        return [
            "Documentation is overrated, good code documents itself",
            "Light mode users have trust issues",
            "PHP isn't THAT bad... okay it's pretty bad"
        ]

me = Daniel()
print("Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something that doesn't suck! 🚀")
```

**🎯 What I'm up to:** Building MAGSEL - an AI-powered metaverse learning platform. Yes, metaverse. No, it's not just VR chat with extra steps.

**🌱 Currently learning:** How to make AI models stop being confidently wrong about everything

**💬 Ask me about:** Why your app got hacked (spoiler: probably SQL injection), how to make React stop making you cry, game dev horror stories, or the best toppings for pizza (it's pineapple, deal with it)

**🐛 Bug hunting status:** Still figuring out if I'm actually good at this or just really good at breaking things. Probably both. The line between security researcher and digital vandal is surprisingly thin.

**Finally, an AI that helps you study instead of doing your homework for you**

🧠 Turns your messy notes into actual flashcards and quizzes  
🔐 Secured like Fort Knox (because I'm paranoid about data)  
🐳 Dockerized because deployment shouldn't be hell  
💡 Uses OpenRouter API (because OpenAI is expensive AF)

**Because algorithms are cooler when you can actually see them work**

🎯 Watch Dijkstra's algorithm find the shortest path in real-time  
⚡ Optimized with min-heap because performance matters  
🎨 Clean code that won't make you cry during code review  
🔥 Built with vanilla JS because sometimes you don't need a framework

## 🤝 Let's Connect (I Promise I'm Fun at Parties)

Real talk - I love meeting other developers, especially if you're into:
- **Security stuff** (let's discuss how everything is broken)
- **AI projects** (that actually solve real problems)
- **Open source** (because sharing is caring)
- **Startup ideas** (even the crazy ones)
- **Tech debates** (vim vs emacs? Let's go!)

I respond to emails faster than most people respond to texts, and I'm always down for interesting conversations about tech, life, or why pineapple belongs on pizza.
